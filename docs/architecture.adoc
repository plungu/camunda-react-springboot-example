## Architecture

====
The diagram above illustrates the interactions and logical components of the app. Note the app is all packed together into one artifact for easier development and PoC ing. But each component could be easily it's own deployable artifact.

Note the *Custom UI* is not depicted. For all intents an purposes it is a completely seperate app and is not depended on the workflow. The interaction between the *Ordering UI* and the workflow is asynchronous. Since the *Notification* workflow simple directs the user to the *Order UI* which then allows a user to complete the order without interacting with the workflow.

Once an order is complete the Approval Workflow is started but is not dependent on the order UI in any way. The approval workflow interacts with users and the inventory API.

Purple lines signify point-to-point synchronous HTTP/REST interactions with the workflow and other components.

This application utilizes mostly synchronous blocking API calls to the JAVA and REST API's. Though as explained prevoiusly there are some subtle but important asynchronous and choreographed interactions.
